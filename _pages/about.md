I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In May 2022, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Florida (Go Gators!). 
My general research interests lie in cyber-physical systems security, embedded systems security, and network security. I enjoy working with big data sets and hardware.
