I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the CPSec Lab, advised by Professor Saman Zonouz. If you want to learn a little more about our lab and what we do, check out this link: https://sites.gatech.edu/capcpsec/.

In May 2022, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Florida (Go Gators!).  
  
My general research interests lie in cyber-physical systems security and network security.
