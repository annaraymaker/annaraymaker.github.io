I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the [CPSec Lab]([http://example.com](https://sites.gatech.edu/capcpsec/)), advised by Professor Saman Zonouz. 

In May 2022, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Florida (Go Gators!).  
  
My general research interests lie in cyber-physical systems security and network security.
