Hello! I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I work in the [CPSec Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/capcpsec/), advised by [Professor Saman Zonouz](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz). 

In May 2022, I acquired a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of Florida [HWCOE](https://www.eng.ufl.edu/) (Go Gators!).  
  
My general research interests are in cyber-physical systems security and network security.
  
If you want to get in touch, feel free to [email me](mailto:araymaker3@gatech.edu) :)
